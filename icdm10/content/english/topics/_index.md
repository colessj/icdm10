The ICDM has always been a 'single stream' conference. There will be no traditional 'sessions' -- instead there will be stream of contributions in a sensible order. The topics proposed here are some areas that we might want to focus on, but are not intended to be restrictive.

With Quantum Crystallography methods now becoming more accessbile, we have a great opportunity to attract many 'structural analysts' to this conference. These researchers who work with crystal structures day in and day out, may not be aware of the real advantages that Quantum Crystallography can bring to their work. So, we would like to find people that can introduce the proposed topic areas in a way that is suitable for a general crystallographic audience with a view to broadening the ICDM community.
